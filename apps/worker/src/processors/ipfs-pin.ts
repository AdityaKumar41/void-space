/**
 * `ipfs-pin` processor (SRS §3.8, FR-8.1–FR-8.4).
 *
 * Reads the staged upload, adds it to the local Kubo node with pinning enabled, records
 * the CID against the version and removes the staged copy. The CID is the
 * tamper-evident fingerprint the licence contract anchors on (§3.9), so it is written
 * inside the tenant transaction together with the audit row.
