/**
 * The landing page — the root URL.
 *
 * It answers "what is this and why would I buy it". The first version of this page made the mistake the
 * whole product is built to avoid: it showed a code frame, monospace bracket labels and a terminal,
 * which is how you sell a developer tool and how you *fail* to sell a marketplace for 3D content.
 * Nobody buys a DAM because its `curl` output is pretty. They buy it because the library looks like a
 * shop and the licence holds up.
 *
 * So the page leads with the thing itself — a real licensed model, turning, from this workspace's own
 * catalogue — and then explains, in order, what happens to an asset, what a record proves, what the
 * platform does, who it is for, and where it stops.
 *
 * It is rendered per request, because the figures in the band below the hero are a *live claim about
 * the catalogue*: "4 models licensed" is either true right now or it is a lie, and a cached count is
 * the second one. The API reads are tolerant — if the API is unreachable the page degrades to its
 * argument without the numbers rather than failing.
