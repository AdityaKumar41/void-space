# VS-SDD-2.0 — REST API contract (Phase 3)

**Companion to** `VOID-SPACE_SRS_v2.0_Production.docx` — satisfies §3.1 ("a documented,
versioned REST API") and §6.4. Authority order: the SRS is normative; this document
describes how the API implements it. Anything marked *Gap-fill* is not enumerated in
the SRS and carries a justification.

Base path: `/api/v1` (version in the path; **all** routes below are relative to it).
Interactive discovery: `GET /api/v1/docs` (Swagger UI, non-production only).

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Error envelope

Every non-2xx response has the same shape (`apiErrorSchema` in `@void-space/types`):

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION",
  "message": "Missing permission: audit:view",
  "details": { "required": "audit:view", "granted": ["asset:upload-own", "api:call", "catalog:view"] },
  "requestId": "req-12",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-21T09:12:44.031Z"
}
```

`code` is the stable discriminator — clients branch on it, never on `message`.
`requestId` matches the API log line, so a UI error report can be traced (§3.2).

### 1.2 Status codes in use

| Code | Meaning in this API | Representative `code` values |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Malformed body/params/query | `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| 401 | Missing, expired or malformed credential | `NO_TOKEN`, `TOKEN_INVALID`, `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `REFRESH_INVALID`, `REFRESH_REUSE_DETECTED`, `API_KEY_INVALID`, `ONBOARDING_EXPIRED` |
| 403 | Authenticated but not permitted | `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION`, `READ_ONLY_TOKEN`, `TENANT_SUSPENDED`, `ROLE_ESCALATION_BLOCKED`, `NOT_A_MEMBER`, `WALLET_SOLE_METHOD` |
| 404 | Unknown resource (also used for a consumed invite token) | `NOT_FOUND` |
| 409 | State conflict | `SLUG_TAKEN`, `LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_SELF`, `INVITE_ALREADY_USED`, `ROLE_UNCHANGED` |
| 429 | Rate limited | `RATE_LIMITED` |
| 503 | Optional capability not configured | `GOOGLE_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `SIWE_DISABLED`, `ROLES_NOT_SEEDED` |

### 1.3 Authentication

| Client | Credential | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Browser | `vs_access` (≤15 min JWT) + `vs_refresh` (rotating, 7 d) | httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookies; refresh cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth` (FR-2.3, §2.5) |
| Machine | API key → short-lived bearer token | `POST /auth/token`, then `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (FR-2.5) |

An `Authorization` header, when present, is authoritative: a bad one yields 401 and the
request never silently falls back to the cookie.

Roles and permissions are **re-read from the database on every request**, so a role
change, a removed membership or a suspended workspace takes effect on the next request
rather than at token expiry (FR-2.7, FR-1.5).

## 2. Endpoints

Legend — 🔓 public · 🔐 authenticated · 🔑 permission required (see the §3.6 matrix)

### 2.1 Authentication — `apps/api/src/modules/auth`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | 🔓 | FR-1.1 self-service signup: creates tenant + first TenantAdmin + settings in one transaction, returns a session |
| POST | `/auth/login` | 🔓 | FR-2.1 email/password. Returns `{ requiresTenantSelection: true, tenants: [...] }` when the person belongs to several workspaces (FR-1.4); re-post with `tenantId` to complete |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | 🔓 | FR-2.3 rotation. Replaying a superseded token returns `REFRESH_REUSE_DETECTED` and revokes the whole session family (§3.7) |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | 🔓 | Revokes the presented refresh token; clears cookies |
| POST | `/auth/logout-all` | 🔐 | FR-2.7 "sign out everywhere" |
| POST | `/auth/token` | 🔓 | FR-2.5 API key → bearer token (no cookie session) |
| POST | `/auth/tenant` | 🔐 | FR-1.4 switch active workspace, issuing a new tenant-scoped session |
| GET | `/auth/me` | 🔐 | §6.1 session shell: user, active tenant, roles, permissions, `readOnly` |
| PATCH | `/auth/password` | 🔐 | FR-2.7 change password; revokes **all** the user's refresh tokens |
| GET | `/auth/sessions` | 🔐 | Active sessions for account settings |
| POST | `/auth/invite/accept` | 🔓 | FR-2.6 accept an invitation (sets name + password, returns a session) |
| GET | `/auth/providers` | 🔓 | Which login methods are configured (password / Google / wallet) |
| GET | `/auth/google/start` | 🔓 | FR-2.2 redirect to Google (503 when unconfigured) |
| GET | `/auth/google/callback` | 🔓 | Code exchange; signs in, or sets the onboarding cookie on first sign-in |
| POST | `/auth/google/complete` | 🔓¹ | FR-2.2 first SSO: create the workspace (¹ requires the httpOnly onboarding cookie) |
| POST | `/auth/siwe/nonce` | 🔓 | FR-2.6 EIP-4361 challenge for an address |
| POST | `/auth/siwe/verify` | 🔓/🔐 | With a session: **links** the wallet. Without: **signs in** an already-linked wallet |
| GET | `/auth/wallets` | 🔐 | Linked wallets |
| DELETE | `/auth/wallets/:id` | 🔐 | Unlink (detaches; the wallet row survives for provenance) |

Rate limits: login 10/min, register 5/hour, refresh 60/min per client. The `test`
environment relaxes them (`TEST_LIMITS` in `modules/auth/routes.ts`) because every
`inject()` request shares one IP.

### 2.2 Tenant administration — `apps/api/src/modules/tenant`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/tenant` | 🔐 | Current workspace: settings, suspended reason, counts (users, assets, licences, awaiting review) |
| PATCH | `/tenant/settings` | 🔑 `tenant:manage` | FR-14.3 upload defaults + webhook endpoint |
| GET | `/tenants` | 🔑 `tenant:manage` | FR-14.1 platform tenant list |
| PATCH | `/tenants/:id/status` | 🔑 `tenant:manage` | FR-1.5 suspend/reinstate; revokes every session in the tenant |

> The platform role is denied the asset/review/licence tables by database grant (§5.3),
> so `/tenants` reports user counts only. Content counts come from the tenant-scoped
> `/tenant` endpoint.

### 2.3 Users & roles — `apps/api/src/modules/users`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/users` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | FR-1.2 member list |
| POST | `/users/invite` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | FR-1.2 invite by email + role (supersedes a pending invite) |
| GET | `/users/invites` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | Pending/completed invitations |
| PATCH | `/users/:id` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | FR-1.3 set role; revokes that user's sessions (FR-2.7) |
| PATCH | `/users/:id/status` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | Activate/deactivate; deactivation revokes sessions |
| DELETE | `/users/:id` | 🔑 `tenant:manage-users` | FR-1.3 remove from workspace (soft: membership removed, account suspended — FR-13.1 keeps the history) |
| GET | `/roles` | 🔐 | The §3.6 catalogue with each role's permissions |

Guards beyond RBAC: only a SuperAdmin may grant/revoke `SuperAdmin`
(`ROLE_ESCALATION_BLOCKED`); a workspace must always keep one active administrator
(`LAST_ADMIN`); you cannot remove your own membership (`CANNOT_REMOVE_SELF`).

### 2.4 Assets — `apps/api/src/modules/assets`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/assets` | 🔑 `asset:upload-own` | FR-3.1 streamed `multipart/form-data` upload: metadata fields first, file last. Returns the full asset detail |
| GET | `/assets` | 🔑 `catalog:view` | FR-3.5 library: `q`, `status`/`statuses`, `tag`, `category`, `creatorId`, `format`, `publishedOnly`, paginated. A Creator is scoped to their own assets, a Viewer to published ones |
| GET | `/assets/:id` | 🔑 `catalog:view` | FR-3.4 detail: versions, AI suggestion, decisions, comment tree, jobs, audit trail, capabilities |
| PATCH | `/assets/:id` | 🔑 `asset:upload-own` | FR-3.2 edit metadata while the asset is still editable |
| POST | `/assets/:id/versions` | 🔑 `asset:upload-own` | FR-3.4 new version (multipart); earlier versions stay immutable |
| POST | `/assets/:id/submit` | 🔑 `asset:upload-own` | FR-3.3 move into the review queue and enqueue AI enrichment |
| DELETE | `/assets/:id` | 🔑 `asset:delete-own-unpublished` | FR-3.6 delete unpublished work; refused for approved/published/licensed assets |

Upload rules: extensions `.glb .gltf .obj .fbx .stl .blend`, ≤ 200 MB (FR-3.1), declared
MIME must agree with the extension (NFR-SEC.3), and the category must be one the workspace
allows (FR-14.3). Unpublished assets answer `404` rather than `403` to callers who may not
see them, so the API cannot be used to enumerate another workspace's work.

Asynchronous work enqueued by these routes: `ipfs-pin` (FR-8.1) and `ai-enrichment`
(FR-7.x). Each job is mirrored into `jobs` and surfaced on the asset detail, so the UI polls
one endpoint (FR-11.2).

### 2.5 Audit — `apps/api/src/modules/audit`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/audit` | 🔑 `audit:view` | FR-13.1–13.2 paginated log with `actorId`, `action`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `from`, `to` filters, plus `actions`/`actors` facets for the filter UI |

Read-only by construction: `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `audit_logs` are revoked from the
runtime role at the database level (FR-13.3), so there is no write path to expose.

### 2.6 Health — `/health`

| Method | Path | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | 🔓 | Dependency status: Postgres, IPFS, Anvil, optional integrations (§9.3) |

## 3. Gap-fills introduced in Phase 3

Each of these is an implementation necessity that the SRS does not enumerate. They are
listed so a reviewer can accept or reject them explicitly rather than discovering them
in the code. Same treatment as the Phase 2 data-model gap-fills.

| Item | SRS reference | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` table + `Session` model | FR-2.3, FR-2.7 | A rotating, revocable refresh token needs server-side state; a stateless JWT cannot be invalidated. Only a SHA-256 hash of the token is stored, and `replacedById` records the rotation chain. |
| API keys embed the tenant id (`vs_<label>_<tenantHex>_<secret>`) | FR-2.5 | `api_keys` is RLS-protected, so resolving a key to its tenant **before** any query keeps the platform role out of the key table (§5.3). The embedded id is an identifier, not a secret. |
| `tenant.user_reinstated`, `auth.wallet_unlinked` audit actions | FR-1.3, FR-2.6 | Both operations are reversible, and the audit log (FR-13.2) must be able to show a reinstatement or an unlink as a distinct event. |
| `/auth/providers`, `/tenant`, `/users/*`, `/roles` | §6.1, FR-1.2/1.3 | The SRS specifies the capabilities (workspace switcher, member administration, settings) without fixing paths; the frontend needs read models for them. |
| SIWE nonce store is in-process | FR-2.6 | Correct for the single-API-instance local stack; a horizontally scaled deployment moves this map to the Redis already in the compose stack. Recorded so it is not forgotten. |
| Wallet unlink detaches instead of deleting | FR-2.6, §3.9.2 | A minted licence may reference the address; deleting the row would break provenance. |

## 4. Open questions for the SRS owner

1. **FR-14.3 vs the §3.6 matrix.** The matrix grants "Manage tenants (create/suspend)"
   to SuperAdmin only, and gives TenantAdmin `tenant:manage-users`. As implemented, a
   TenantAdmin can administer members but cannot change their own workspace's upload
   defaults. Should `tenant:manage` be added to TenantAdmin, or does §3.6 stand?
2. **Invitation delivery.** §3.9 mentions Resend for transactional email. No provider is
   configured in this stack, so `POST /users/invite` returns the raw token once and the
   UI relays it out-of-band. Confirm whether mail delivery is in scope for this release.
3. **Per-session revocation.** FR-2.3 makes sessions visible; it does not say whether a
   user may revoke one other session from the UI. Only revoke-all is implemented.

## 5. Test traceability (Phase 3)

| TC-AUTH-005 (API key → Developer scope) | `apps/api/test/api-keys.test.ts` |
| TC-AUTH-006 (password change kills sessions) | `apps/api/test/auth.test.ts` |
| TC-AUTH-007 (rotation, reuse detection) | `apps/api/test/auth.test.ts` |
| FR-2.2 SSO + onboarding | `apps/api/test/google-sso.test.ts` |
| FR-2.6 SIWE (real signatures) | `apps/api/test/siwe.test.ts` |
| FR-1.2/1.3/1.5, FR-2.7, FR-13.1 | `apps/api/test/tenant-admin.test.ts` |
| Cross-tenant isolation (NFR-SEC.5) | `packages/db/test/tenant-isolation.test.ts`, `tenant-admin.test.ts` |
